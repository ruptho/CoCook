# CoCook

A quite simple Android App (managing the contents of your fridge and cooking recipes) which includes inclusion of a very basic "hand-swipe-functionality" for switching between fragments/activities without touching the screen (only uses the front camera) by using OpenCV API.

Created as an assignment for a university course "Sensors and User Models" at Graz University of Technology.
